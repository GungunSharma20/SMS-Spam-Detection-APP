# SMS-Spam-Detection-APP
This SMS Spam Detection App is built using Streamlit and Machine Learning to classify messages as spam or ham in real time. It uses CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical features and a Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes model for classification. Users can enter an SMS, and the app instantly predicts whether it's spam or not. This project helps in filtering unwanted messages and enhancing communication security with a simple UI and efficient detection mechanism.
